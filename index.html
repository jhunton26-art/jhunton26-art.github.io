            <p>
                Our 2025 challenger is powered by a Ferrari engine, providing a superior balance of power and reliability. [cite: 16] This allows our R&D to focus on our core strengths in chassis and aerodynamics. [cite: 17] The car features the "Glitch-Stream Livery," where sharp, angular teal decals streak across the matte purple bodywork, simulating digital data streams breaking apart at speed. [cite: 11]
